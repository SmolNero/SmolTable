## What is SmolTable?

SmolTable is a local-first, zero-bloat celebration planning tool.It helps families and communities coordinate intimate eventsâ€”from birthday dinners to seasonal ritualsâ€”by combining:

- AI-assisted event planning (`SmolPlan`)
- Lightweight vendor matching (`LocalNet`)
- Contribution-based invites (so everyone brings something)
- A living celebration journal

It runs offline using **Go + SQLite**, and will eventually support desktop, mobile, and webâ€”all from one portable build.

## Why?

Big platforms are bloated.
Most planners focus on logistics, not emotion.
SmolTable is built for *intentional gatherings*â€”where food, memory, and participation matter more than scale.

Itâ€™s a tool, not a feed. A ritual assistant, not a calendar.
